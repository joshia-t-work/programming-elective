        <p class="intro">This class is designed to introduce you to the world of programming and help you develop
            essential coding skills. Below are some important policies and guidelines to ensure a productive learning
            environment.</p>

        <section id="classroom-policies" class="card">
            <h2>Classroom Policies</h2>
            <ul class="policy-list">
                <li><strong>Respectful Behavior:</strong> Treat your classmates and teacher with respect. Disruptive
                    behavior will not be tolerated.</li>
                <li><strong>Attendance:</strong> Regular attendance is crucial for success in this class. If you miss a
                    class, it is your responsibility to catch up on missed work.</li>
                <li><strong>Assignments:</strong> Complete all assigned work by the due date. Late submissions may
                    result in a grade penalty.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="toilet-policy" class="card">
            <h2>Toilet Policy</h2>
            <p>There are no toilet passes in this class. You can go to the restroom anytime, <strong>AT YOUR OWN
                    RISK</strong>. My advice is only going to the restroom under emergency situations. If for some
                reason the whole class agrees having a toilet pass is incredibly important, I will try to ask for one,
                but for the most part you are at the age where you already know when you need to go during breaks.</p>
            </br>
            <button type="button" class="btn" onclick="petition()" aria-label="Petition for a toilet pass">Petition for
                a Toilet Pass</button>
        </section>

        <section id="ai-policy" class="card">
            <h2>AI Usage Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>AI is a tool for learning, not a shortcut.</strong> You are encouraged to use AI to help you
                brainstorm ideas, get unstuck on errors, or understand advanced code <em>after</em> you've tried on your
                own. However, you must be able to explain and adapt any code or explanation you get from AI. If you
                can't explain it, you don't own it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Allowed:</strong> Brainstorming project ideas, asking for debugging help, getting code
                    suggestions for advanced/optional features, and asking for explanations <em>after</em> you've tried
                    yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>Not Allowed:</strong> Submitting AI-generated work you don't understand, copy-pasting whole
                    projects, or using AI to bypass assignments without effort.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For all projects and homework, if you use AI, <strong>document how you used it</strong> (e.g., “I asked
                AI to help me randomize colors and then changed the code to fit my page”, think of this as a "Get out of
                Jail card", I won't force you to explain AI generated code you don't understand, but if you claim to
                make it yourself, you must understand it). During quizzes and live coding, AI use will be restricted.
            </p>
            <p>Remember: <em>Understanding matters more than answers.</em> AI can help you, but your growth comes from
                what <strong>you</strong> can do with it.</p>

        <section id="laptop-policy" class="card">
            <h2>Laptop Usage Policy</h2>
            <p>Laptops are permitted for use during class, as this is a programming elective. However, if I observe a
                laptop being used without permission for non-class-related activities, I reserve the right to collect
                the device and return it at the end of class. During breaks, laptops should remain closed or covered
                unless you have received explicit permission to use them. Please use your device responsibly and only
                for class purposes unless otherwise approved.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="tablet-policy" class="card">
            <h2>Tablet Usage Policy</h2>
            <p>If I see a tablet out during class, I will take it and return it at the <b>end of the school
                    day</b>—unless you have asked for permission to use it. Please ask first if you have a good reason
                to use your tablet in class.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="learning-policy" class="card">
            <h2>Learning Policy</h2>
            <p>I understand that not everyone will be passionate about programming, and that's okay! My goal is to
                support you in learning at your own pace and making the most of this elective you chose. If you ever
                feel unmotivated or want to try something different, please talk to me—I'm here to help you find a way
                to stay engaged. However, being part of this class means taking responsibility for your own learning and
                making an honest effort. If you consistently choose not to participate or learn, I may need to contact
                your parents, as per school guidelines.</p>
            <p><strong>Unfinished Classwork:</strong> Any classwork you do not finish during class automatically becomes
                homework and should be completed at home. Please manage your time effectively and seek help if needed.
                While I will not always check these, doing it will help your learning and success in this class.</p>

        <section id="internet-policy" class="card highlight">
            <h2>Internet Policy</h2>
            <p>Students have full internet access to support faster learning. However, I have full permission to restrict usage; if I see misuse, I will take the device. Please use the internet wisely.</p>
            <ul class="policy-list">
                <li><strong>Allowed:</strong> Looking up a concept or topic, HTML tags, CSS syntax, documentation, and examples.</li>
                <li><strong>Not allowed:</strong> Cheating, copying answers, or any activity you would hide from the teacher or from God—if you would hide it, don't do it.</li>
