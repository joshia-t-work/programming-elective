        <section id="classroom-policies" class="card">
            <h2>Classroom Policies</h2>
            <ul class="policy-list">
                <li><strong>Respectful Behavior:</strong> Treat your classmates and teacher with respect. Disruptive behavior will not be tolerated.</li>
                <li><strong>Attendance:</strong> Regular attendance is crucial for success in this class. If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to catch up on missed work.</li>
                <li><strong>Assignments:</strong> Complete all assignments on time. Late submissions may result in a grade penalty.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="toilet-policy" class="card">
            <h2>Toilet Policy</h2>
            <p>There are no toilet passes in this class. You can go to the restroom anytime, <strong>AT YOUR OWN RISK</strong>. My advice is only going to the restroom under emergency situations. If for some reason the whole class agrees having a toilet pass is incredibly important, I will try to ask for one, but for the most part you are at the age where you already know when you need to go during breaks.</p>
            <button type="button" class="btn" onclick="petition()" aria-label="Petition for a toilet pass">Petition for a Toilet Pass</button>

        <section id="ai-policy" class="card">
            <h2>AI Usage Policy</h2>
            <p>DO NOT USE AI unless you understand what you are doing. Not because it is cheating, but for your own sake. I will not stop AI completions and AI tools being used, but you should at least understand that every copy-paste, and every moment you don't use your brain well is a missed learning opportunity. It won't hurt you now but if you have the slightest interest in programming it will hurt you later (someone without AI will work better with AI, someone with AI will basically malfunction without it). Cheating is not something new; robbing your future self is something people do all the time. AI just makes it easier, so ask the right questions. Think of AI as your teacher: it makes sense to ask "how do I do this properly" but "can you please answer this question" doesn't make sense.</p>
            <p>In the future, there will be assignments with GPT recommended and not recommended. You can choose not to follow, but in my opinion, I would rather feel stupid back at school rather than feel smart but actually cannot do anything after graduating college.</p>

        <section id="laptop-policy" class="card">
            <h2>Laptop Usage Policy</h2>
            <p>I have full permission to take your laptop when I see usage without permission (returned by the end of class), but I think it's a bit unfair and in most cases silly for a programming elective. So during class I'll assume you all have my permission unless I explicitly say otherwise. During breaks I expect laptops to be either closed or covered unless you ask permission.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="tablet-policy" class="card">
            <h2>Tablet Usage Policy</h2>
            <p>No tablets except with permission. I have full permission to take your tablet (returned by the end of school). What are you going to do there—watch YouTube or TikTok?</p>
        </section>

        <section id="learning-policy" class="card">
            <h2>Learning Policy</h2>
            <p>Since I know not everyone is going to be interested in programming, I will not force you to learn, but you have to be responsible since you chose this elective. If you are not interested in learning anything and you want to do something else, then I will have to ask you to leave the class and, by guidelines, notify your parents.</p>
